# TwitterParser

Idea so far:
Python Parsing script using Twitter API with Twython wrapper saves tweets in a text file.
C# Application to properly sort tweets in data structures.
AHK script to regularly schedule the parser to run/update tweets.

TODO:
Properly format text file input in parser.
Make c# app read from that text file.
Make AHK script to schedule parser once it's finished.
Figure out the Regex's for sorting through tweets.
Create unit tests.
Convert programs to runnable exe's.
