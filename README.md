# TwitterParser

Idea so far:
Python Parsing script using Twitter API with Twython wrapper saves tweets in a text file.
C# Application to properly sort tweets in data structures.
AHK script to regularly schedule the parser to run/update tweets.

TODO:
Make c# app read from that text file.
Make AHK script to schedule parser once it's finished.
Create unit tests.
Convert programs to runnable exe's.
