# TwitterParser

#To Get or Update the Tweets from a User:

-Navigate to `src\PythonParser`
-Through the command line run TwitterParser.py. The parameter it will take will be the twitter username:

Ex. `$ python TwitterParser.py loyolachicago`

This will run and Parse LoyolaChicago's twitter page for the 200 most recent tweets and store them in tweets.txt

#To Run the Engine:
-Open "ParsingEngine.sln" in an IDE.
-This will give all the tweets from the parser and label their mentions, topics, and links given.
-Then you have the option to sort the tweets and see the frequency of all the mentions, topics, and links used.
